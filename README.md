# Alphabet-Simon-Says-game
The Alphabet Simon Says Game is a fun and challenging project that tests and improves
your memory skills. This game is a creative twist on the classic Simon Says game. Instead
of colors, players will be presented with flashing alphabets, adding an additional layer of
complexity and memory challenge. 

Features :-
1. Allow players to input their responses by clicking on the displayed alphabets or using
keyboard keys.
2. Implemented a time limit for players to replicate each sequence,
increasing the difficulty as the game progresses.
3. Display a game-over message when the
player makes a mistake or fails to replicate the sequence within the time limit.


Try it out and challenge your memory! ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡
